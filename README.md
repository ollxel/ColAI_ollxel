# 🧠 WebSim Neural Collaborative Interface

> ⚠️ This project is designed to run **exclusively inside WebSim** — it relies on WebSim's internal LLM API handling.

## 📌 About the project

This is an experimental interface for interacting with LLMs inside WebSim, offering features such as:

- Full control over generation parameters (temperature, top-p, top-k, etc.)
- Multi-model collaborative generation
- Clean HTML + JavaScript UI (vanilla, no frameworks)

The goal is to enable **fully local AI workflows** with direct control over everything — no cloud, no spyware.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML / CSS / JS** (Vanilla)
- **WebSim internal APIs**
- **WebLLM** backend integration (inside WebSim)

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- Won’t work outside WebSim (the main logic calls internal WebSim APIs)
- This repo may appear inactive, but it contains the **original implementation** of a feature that has since been reused elsewhere

---

## 🧩 Why it matters

This repo predates several current implementations of local LLM frontends. It's meant to serve both as:

1. A **reference** implementation for WebSim-based UI integration
2. A **timestamp** showing prior work before public alternatives appeared
